# Error Handling Contract

## Overview

This Solidity smart contract demonstrates the usage of error handling mechanisms: `require()`, `assert()`, and `revert()`. These statements are essential for validating input conditions, ensuring internal consistency, and handling exceptional scenarios within a smart contract.

## Contract Details

The contract is named `ErrorHandlingContract` and includes the following variable and function:

### Variables

- `uint256 public value`: This public variable stores an integer value.

### Functions

- `setValue(uint256 _newValue)`: This public function allows updating the `value` with the provided `_newValue`.

## Error Handling Mechanisms

### `require()`

The `require()` statement is used to check input conditions or pre-conditions before executing a function. If the condition provided to `require()` evaluates to `false`, the contract execution will be reverted, and any changes made before the `require()` statement will be discarded. This helps to prevent invalid states and protect against unexpected behavior.

In this contract, `require()` is used to check if the `_newValue` provided to `setValue()` is greater than zero. If the condition is not met, the transaction will revert with the error message "Value must be greater than zero."

### `assert()`

The `assert()` statement is used to validate internal state consistency during contract execution. It is generally used to ensure that certain invariants hold true. If the condition provided to `assert()` evaluates to `false`, it indicates an internal error, and the contract execution will be reverted. Unlike `require()`, `assert()` is used to catch bugs and should not be used for input validation.

In this contract, `assert()` is used to verify that the result of adding `value` and `_newValue` is greater than the original `value`. If this condition is not met, the contract execution will revert due to an internal error.

### `revert()`

The `revert()` statement is used to revert the entire transaction execution with a custom error message. It is commonly used to explicitly reject specific inputs or conditions that are not allowed in the contract. If the code block containing `revert()` is executed, the transaction will revert, and any changes made before the `revert()` statement will be discarded.

In this contract, `revert()` is used to reject the transaction if the provided `_newValue` is equal to 42. If this condition is met, the transaction will revert with the error message "The value 42 is not allowed."
